A decently performant, browser-based Live2D viewer designed for interaction with one or more Live2D models. Built with vanilla JavaScript and the PIXI.js rendering engine.  
This project offers a feature-rich experience without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

It includes a dynamic UI, multi-model support, a GitHub repository explorer for discovering new models, and a "What's New" changelog modal, all wrapped in a clean, responsive design.

## Installation

To run the viewer locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

2.  **Open in a browser:**
    You can open `index.html` directly in a modern browser.

3.  **(Recommended) Serve locally:**
    For best results and to avoid potential CORS issues when loading models, run a local web server.

    # If you have Python 3 installed:
    python3 -m http.server

    # Then, open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
    ```
